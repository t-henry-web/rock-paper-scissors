# rock-paper-scissors
JavaScript rock paper scissors game

The script needs to:
-Take user input as rock, paper or scissors. This should be filtered to be case-insensitive
-The computer randomly chooses rock paper or scissors equally
-The script assesses whether the player or computer wins, declares the winner, and adds the win to that player's score variable
-The game is repeated for 5 rounds, with the overall winner declared
